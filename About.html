								<p>My First Website</p>

							<p>Hi Viewers, This is my first online website. At first website development for me was a hobby and a thing to pass time. But as time went my interest in website development grew. I started to find diffrent courses for learning website development and lockdown was the time when my hobby got a perfect acceleration. I started to do diffrent courses which I found on Edx.com and coursea. This website is also an outcome from a course named <b>Zero2Maker</b> website devlopment program. I also like software and game development and to learn software and game development python is neccsary so I started learning python too. I will even try to share you all my games through this website</p>

				  <p>The Subject on which I made this website is completely diffrent from my above hobbies. Photography my very first hobby through which entered this world of technology. At initial stage of learning photography I used Canon PowerShot A630 after wards is switched to Nikon P900 and I currently us Sony Alpha 7 II. All th photos in this website are taken by Me.   </p>
